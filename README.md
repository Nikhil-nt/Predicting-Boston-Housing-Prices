# Predicting-Boston-Housing-Prices

# Project Overview
The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and I want to be the best real estate agent in the area. To compete with my peers, I decide to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist me and a client with finding the best selling price for their home. Luckily, Iâ€™ve come across the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. My task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then be used to estimate the best selling price for my clients' homes.

# Project Highlights
Many techniques are highlighted in the project for training, testing, evaluating, and optimizing models available in sklearn. The things i learnt in the project are:

* How to explore data and observe features.
* How to train and test models.
* How to identify potential problems, such as errors due to bias or variance.
* How to apply techniques to improve the model, such as cross-validation and grid search.
